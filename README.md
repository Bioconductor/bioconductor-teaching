# Bioconductor teaching working group


The goal of the Bioconductor teaching working group is to define a
curriculum and implement on-line lessons for beginner and more
advanced R users who want to learn to analyse their data with
Bioconductor packages.

This meta-repository is used for general discussions. The respective
lessons are developed as modules in their own repositories.

## Modules

- The **Data science** lesson is based on the [Carpentries Ecology
  Curriculum](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop). There
  are no pre-requisites for this module, and the materials assume no
  prior knowledge about R and Bioconductor. It introduces R, RStudio,
  teaches data cleaning, management, analysis, and visualisation and
  introduces some Bioconductor concepts.

- The **Bioconductor project** lesson provides an introduction to the
  Bioconductor project such as the Bioconductor home page, packages,
  package landing pahes and package vignettes, where to find help,
  Bioconductor workflows, Bioconductor release schedule and versions,
  some core infrastructure, ... It is meant to be use in combination
  with other modules as part of a wider workshop.

- **Analysis and interpretation of bulk RNA-Sequencing data using
  Bioconductor** shows how to use Bioconductor packages to analyse
  RNA-Seq data. It expects good familiarity with R and the
  Bioconductor project.
