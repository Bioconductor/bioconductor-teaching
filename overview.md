# Data organisation with Spreadsheets (DC)

Questions:

- What are basic principles for using spreadsheets for good data
  organization?

Objectives:

- Describe best practices for organizing data so computers can make
the best use of data sets.

Keypoints:

- Good data organization is the foundation of any research project.


# Starting with R  (DC)

**Learning Objectives**

- Describe the purpose of the RStudio Script, Console, Environment, and Plots
  panes.

- Organize files and directories for a set of analyses as an R
  project, and understand the purpose of the working directory.

- Use the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more
  information on R functions.

- Demonstrate how to provide sufficient information for
  troubleshooting with the R user community.

# Starting with data (DC)

**Learning Objectives**

- Describe what a data frame is.
- Load external data from a .csv file into a data frame.
- Summarize the contents of a data frame.
- Describe what a factor is.
- Convert between strings and factors.
- Reorder and rename factors.
- Change how character strings are handled in a data frame.
- Export and save data.

# Manipulating and analyzing data with dplyr (DC)

**Learning Objectives**

- Describe the purpose of the **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** packages.

- Select certain columns in a data frame with the **`dplyr`** function
  `select`.

- Select certain rows in a data frame according to filtering
  conditions with the **`dplyr`** function `filter` .

- Link the output of one **`dplyr`** function to the input of another
  function with the 'pipe' operator `%>%`.

- Add new columns to a data frame that are functions of existing
  columns with `mutate`.

- Use the split-apply-combine concept for data analysis.

- Use `summarize`, `group_by`, and `count` to split a data frame into
  groups of observations, apply summary statistics for each group, and
  then combine the results.

- Describe the concept of a wide and a long table format and for which
  purpose those formats are useful.

- Describe what key-value pairs are.

- Reshape a data frame from long to wide format and back with the
  `spread`/`pivot_wider` and `gather`/`pivot_longer` commands from the
  **`tidyr`** package.

# Data visualization (DC)

**Learning Objectives**

* Produce scatter plots, boxplots, and time series plots using ggplot.
* Set universal plot settings.
* Describe what faceting is and apply faceting in ggplot.
* Modify the aesthetics of an existing ggplot plot (including axis labels and color).
* Build complex and customized plots from data in a data frame.


# Joining tables

**Learning Objectives**

At the end of this section, students should understand

* the need and concept of table joins,
* different between different types of joins,
* the importance of keys in joins,
* circumstances leading to the appearance of missing values,
* the implications of using non-unique keys.

# Reproducible research

**Learning Objectives**

- Understand the concept of reproducible research and reproducible
  documents.
- Undertand the process by which a source document in compiled into a
  final report.
- Generate a reproducible report in html or pdf from an Rmarkdown
  document using RStudio.
